        This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens.
        The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus.
        It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows
        or prairies.
        Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers.
        The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered.
        Bulbs should be planted in the autumn.

    <p> With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle above
        bright emerald-green leaves -- this nearly deer-proof shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned
        way. But the pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly, and anyone who
        gardens in
        a small space will want to watch this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates shade well.</em>
